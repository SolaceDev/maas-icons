## Setup npm registry

Before installing the package this step needs to be completed.

You can authenticate to GitHub Packages with npm by creating a npmrc file in your root directory.

```
@solacedev:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=GITHUB_TOKEN
```

GITHUB_TOKEN needs to be replaced by user specific github token. Make sure the package permissions ( write:packages, read:packages ) are correctly selected during token creation, and SSO is also enabled.

See this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to see how to create github token. Read more about [packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages) permissions.

## Install

```bash

npm install --save @solacedev/maas-icons

```

## Usage

Import the svg sprite file to top level of the application.

```tsx

import  React, { Component } from  'react'
import { ReactComponent  as  SolaceSvgs } from  from  '@solacedev/maas-icons/dist/svg/sprite.symbol.svg'

const  App = () => {

return (

<>

// Imported svg sprites should be hidden in the dom.

<div  style={{ display:  "none" }}>

<SolaceSvgs  />

</div>

<OtherComponents>

</>

);

};

```

## Development

# How to add new Icons

1.  Rename the svg file to use camelCase eg: arrowUp.svg
2.  icons directory is the main directory to store svg files. If a new subfolder is required try to use just the size name. eg: icons/24px
3.  Add the new svg file to appropriate folder under **icons** directory
4.  Create a pr and then release the package. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release) for package release.

**Note for developers** : Don't forget to include one of the following values in a commit, before pushing your branch to master. This would trigger a automated package version update.

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
